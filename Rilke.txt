Therefore, my dear friend, 
I know of no other advice than this: 
Go within and scale the depths of your being from which your very life springs forth.
At its source you will find the answer to the question, whether you must write. 
Accept it, 
however it sounds to you, 
without analyzing. 
Perhaps it will become apparent to you that you are indeed called to be a writer.
Then accept that fate; 
bear its burden, 
and its grandeur, 
without asking for the reward, 
which might possibly come from without. 
For the creative artist must be a world of his own and must find everything within himself and in nature,
to which he has betrothed himself.
It is possible that, 
even after your descent into your inner self and into your secret place of solitude, 
you might find that you must give up becoming a poet. 
As I have said, 
to feel that one could live without writing is enough indication that, 
in fact, one should not. 
Even then this process of turning inward,
upon which I beg you to embark, 
will not have been in vain. 
Your life will no doubt from then on find its own paths.
That they will be good ones and rich and expansive
that I wish for you more than I can say.
