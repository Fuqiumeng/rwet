There is indeed the inexpressible. 
This shows itself; 
it is the mystical.
The right method of philosophy would be this. 
To say nothing except what can be said,
the propositions of natural science, 
something that has nothing to do with philosophy: 
and then always, 
when someone else wished to say something metaphysical, 
to demonstrate to him that he had given no meaning to certain signs in his propositions. 
This method would be unsatisfying to the other
he would not have the feeling that we were teaching him philosophy
but it would be the only strictly correct method.
My propositions are elucidatory in this way: 
he who understands me finally recognizes them as senseless, 
when he has climbed out through them, 
on them, 
over them. 
He must so to speak throw away the ladder
after he has climbed up on it.
He must surmount these propositions; 
then he sees the world rightly.
Whereof one cannot speak, 
thereof one must be silent.
